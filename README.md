(1) We propose a novel general paradigm called PGN as the new successor to RNN. It reduces the information propagation path to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, enabling better capture of long-term dependencies in input signals and addressing the limitations of RNNs.

(2) We propose TPGN, a novel temporal modeling framework based on PGN, which comprehensively captures semantic information through two branches. One branch utilizes PGN to capture long-term periodic patterns and preserve their local characteristics, while the other branch employs patches to capture short-term information and aggregates them to obtain a global representation of the series. Notably, TPGN can also accommodate other models, making it be a general temporal modeling framework. 

(3) In terms of efficiency, PGN maintains the same complexity of $\mathcal{O}(L)$ as RNN. However, due to its parallelizable calculations, PGN achieves higher actual efficiency. On the other hand, TPGN, serving as a general temporal modeling framework, exhibits a favorable complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{L})$.



## Get Start of TPGN

1. Install Python>=3.9, PyTorch 1.10.1.
